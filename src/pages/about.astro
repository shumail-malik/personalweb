      <p class="mb-6">
        Born in Rampur district of Uttar Pradesh, I come from a lower middle-class family as the eldest of three brothers. My academic journey has been marked by determination and consistent excellence, starting from securing third rank in Kindergarten to topping my class in later years.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Educational Journey</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">
        My educational path took a significant turn when I qualified for Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, being among just 80 students selected from thousands of applicants. At JNV, I consistently ranked among the top performers and had the enriching experience of participating in the migration program, which exposed me to diverse cultures across India.
